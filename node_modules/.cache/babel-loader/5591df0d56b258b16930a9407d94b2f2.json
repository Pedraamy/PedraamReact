Since I can remember, technology has consumed my life in one way or another. When I took my first coding class in university I fell in love. Never before had academic subject matter mentally stimulated me like CS. As much as I love Biology, solutions to problems are relatively static in nature. You either know this enzyme or you don't. What I love about CS is there are endless ways to arrive at the same solution. Endless ways to code up the same meaning, it feels like an art form in a way school has never felt.
