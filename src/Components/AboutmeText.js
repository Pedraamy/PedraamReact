        <p className="aboutme--text">I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area.
        I am currently studying <b>Computer Science and Integrative Biology at UC Berkeley</b>.
        Since I can remember, technology has consumed my life in one way or another.
        When I took my first coding class in university I fell in love.
        Never before had academic subject matter mentally stimulated me like CS.
        As much as I love Biology, solutions to problems are relatively static in nature.
        You either know the enzyme or you don't.
        What I love about CS is there are endless ways to arrive at the same solution.
        Endless ways to code up the same meaning, it feels like an art form in a way school has never felt.
        Anyways, enough with the eccentrics.
        Some of my favorite hobbies are strategy based games.
        Chess has recently become my favorite game, but I also love playing poker.<br/><br/>
        Last summer, I was a <b>Research Assitant at the UCSF Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center within the Akhurst lab</b> where I worked on cancerous cell lines.
        I liked this role particularly becuase I got to utilize both my backgrounds in CS and Biology.
        I used labrotory techniques like Western blotting to purify proteins from different cell lines.
        I then used <b>Pandas to aggregate and transform large amounts of protein data</b>.
        This effort made the data more digestable for my post-doc to analyze.<br/><br/>
        More recently, I have been spending more time on side projects.
        Something that I have been having a lot of fun with.
        Seeing your ideas come to life using the actual skills you learned in college is very rewarding, to say the least.
        You can see a detailed description of some of my projects plus a video demonstration in the projects section of the website.
        My favorite part about side projects is they enable you to learn technologies that aren't really taught in a traditional CS curriculum.
        As much as I love CS theory, the unfortunate part of academia is the lack of focus on modern techlonogies.
        CS academia never actually covers important modern technologies that are at the forefront of todays tech industry.
        So I taken it upon myself to self-learn many of them before I graduate.
