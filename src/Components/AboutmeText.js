        <p className="aboutme--text">I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area.
        I am currently studying <b>Computer Science and Integrative Biology at UC Berkeley</b>.
        Since I can remember, technology has consumed my life in one way or another.
        When I took my first coding class in university I fell in love.
        Never before had academic subject matter mentally stimulated me like CS.
        As much as I love Biology, solutions to problems are relatively static in nature.
        You either know the enzyme or you don't.
        What I love about CS is there are endless ways to arrive at the same solution.
        Endless ways to code up the same meaning, it feels like an art form in a way school has never felt.
        Anyways, enough with the eccentrics.
        Some of my favorite hobbies are strategy based games.
        Chess has recently become my favorite game, but I also love playing poker.<br/><br/>
        Last summer, I was a <b>Research Assitant at the UCSF Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center within the Akhurst lab</b> where I worked on cancerous cell lines.
        I liked this role particularly becuase I got to utilize both my backgrounds in CS and Biology.
        I used labrotory techniques like Western blotting to purify proteins from different cell lines.
        I then used <b>Pandas to aggregate and transform large amounts of protein data</b>.
        This effort made the data more digestable for my Postdoc to analyze.<br/><br/>
        More recently, I have been spending more time on side projects.
        Over the summer I created a fully functional Chess game and wrote an AI for it using the minimax algorithm.
        Currently, I am building this website from the ground up as an effort to better learn React.
